The current plots show proportion of cases and deaths for 6 selected countries and worldwide by WHO region. 

Notes~
The vacination data will be added to the visualization shortly, and with that data we may be able to state a hypothesis to test the relationship between vaccination rates and death rates. In the hypothesis, other possible explanatory and/or confounding variables nay be population demographics, hosptalization rates, reporting of positive rapid test results without confirmation by a laboratory test and more.

This project consists of activities that develop good story-telling presentations describing covid-19 visualizations of cases, deaths and vaccinations from 2020 to 2022, and applying good programming practices. The underlying code uses the r programming language.

Phase 1: Visualizations use ggplot.
6 countries of interest are selected at any time for direct comparison. The selections may change in the future. 
Worldwide visualizations (if presented) are based on all 6 WHO regions.
The r markdown file (rmd) when included will be saved in the same folder as the r program. 

Guidance rules, suggestions and notes:
Project activities and sub-goals will be agile but managed or self-managed using good programming practices.
All visualizations will use a consistent unit of measure (i.e. "proportion of events" per million) to negate population differences (thus allowing "apples to apples" comparison between countries.)
Missing functionality is to be added soon.
New funtionality will be documented here as part of future planning.
