This project is a means of developing and practicing r coding skills and git knowledge while working towards good story-telling presentations describing 
  covid-19 visualizations of cases, deaths and vaccinations from 2020 to 2022.

Current planned functionality (@country level):
UK vs North America.
UK vs Europe (select 2 countries to compare).
Worldwide visualizations based on WHO regions.
Publishing goals: .rmd (r markdown) file will be created when the r code reaches an acceptable level of development. 

Guidance rules, suggestions and notes:
Project activities and sub-goals will be agile but managed or self-managed to maintain good programming practice.
All visualizations of events use a consistent and common unit of measure across datasets (i.e. <country population events> per million).
Addition of missing and new functionality is a work in progress.
New funtionality will be documented here as part of the project planning process.

New functionality:
