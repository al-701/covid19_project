This project is a means of developing and practicing r coding skills and git knowledge while working towards good story-telling presentations describing 
  covid-19 visualizations of cases, deaths and vaccinations from 2020 to 2022.

Phase 1: ggplot and related plotting:
UK vs North America /
UK vs Europe (3 countries per plot) /
Worldwide visualizations based on WHO regions.
R markdown: .rmd (r markdown) file is a WIP, to be completed with r code development. 

Guidance rules, suggestions and notes:
Project activities and sub-goals will be agile but managed or self-managed for good programming practices.
All visualizations will use a consistent unit of measure (i.e. "events" per million) to negate population differences.
Missing functionality is to be added soon.
New funtionality will be documented here as part of future planning.
