This project is an activity developing good story-telling presentations describing covid-19 visualizations of cases, deaths and vaccinations from 2020 to 2022, and applying good programming practices.

Phase 1: ggplot and other visualizations:
UK vs North America /
UK vs Europe (3 countries per plot) /
Worldwide visualizations based on WHO regions.
R markdown: .rmd (r markdown) file is a WIP, to be completed with r code development. 

Guidance rules, suggestions and notes:
Project activities and sub-goals will be agile but managed or self-managed for good programming practices.
All visualizations will use a consistent unit of measure (i.e. "events" per million) to negate population differences.
Missing functionality is to be added soon.
New funtionality will be documented here as part of future planning.

The current plots show proportion of cases and deaths for 6 countries since early October 2021. The rapid increase in cases does not seem to be matched by a comparable increase in deaths so far. 
The vacination data will be added, which may then allow us to state a hypothesis using vaccination rates as an explanatory variable (vaccination rates).
